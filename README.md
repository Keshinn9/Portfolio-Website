# Porfolio-Website

Portfolio v1
This was my very first personal portfolio website i made for one of my class. I’m keeping this repository active to document my growth as a developer and to preserve the original code I wrote when I first started my journey.

Tech stack
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript

What i learned
  - I learned to use proper tags and not just dive for everything. I learned to use media queries for a responsive website. Also basic javascipt for functionality in my website.

*Currently rebuilding and changing this portfolio website
